# 🚨 Fraud Detection Project

Welcome to the **Fraud Detection Project** — a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card and e-commerce datasets with high accuracy and explainability.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* **Detect fraud** accurately in imbalanced financial transaction datasets
* **Engineer meaningful features** that reveal fraud patterns
* **Train and compare** multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Neural Networks)
* **Interpret model decisions** using SHAP for transparency and trust
* **Deliver actionable insights** to improve fraud prevention strategies

---

## 🗂️ What’s Inside?

* **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** Cleaning, EDA, handling missing values, merging geolocation data, and feature engineering
* **Model Development:** Training baseline and advanced models with imbalanced data handling (SMOTE, undersampling)
* **Model Evaluation:** Metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC tailored for fraud detection challenges
* **Explainability:** SHAP plots (summary, force, bar) to uncover key drivers behind model predictions
* **Reports:** Detailed documentation and visualizations explaining the entire project workflow

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/segnig/ml4fraud-ecommerce-banking.git
```

### Step 2: Setup Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Interactive Visualizations

We leverage SHAP plots to provide deep insights into model behavior:

* **Summary Plot:** Shows which features most influence fraud predictions across all data points
* **Force Plot:** Explains individual transaction predictions—what drives the model to classify it as fraud or not
* **Bar Plot:** Quantifies average importance of each feature globally
